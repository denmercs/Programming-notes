1. *Hi Gaby,* 

   *I'm X, a senior at San Jose State University majoring in Computer Science and Business graduating at the end of 2019, and I'd love to learn about how I could contribute at Discord.* 

   *I’ve been using Discord for more than 3-4 years; from day one I was advocating for all my friends to quit Skype. Surprise! It happened. Seeing how much Discord has improved and how many amazing features* 

   *have been added over the years has made me super proud. Since then I've always been interested in designing awesome things at Discord myself.* 

   *I know you’re super busy, but it would be awesome to be able to hop on a call with you to chat about what software engineering roles you and the Discord team would be potentially hiring for in the near future. Would you be free for a 15-minute call on Monday either at 1:00 pm or 3:00 pm (PST)?* 

   *Just in case, I’ve attached my resume to the email for reference and my resume can be found here (link). I appreciate your time and consideration!* 

   *Regards,*
